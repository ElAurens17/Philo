      <h2>Finding meaning of Life through Philosophy</h2>
		<h2>By 4CL Midn Dacut, Lawrence H.</h2>
		<h3>What is Philosophy?</h3>
      <img src="Philo.jpeg">
		<p>Philosophy is asking &quotwhy?&quot
<ul>
  <li>Why are we here?</li>
  <li>What is right or wrong?</li>
  <li style="color: #ffcc70;">What is the meaning of life?</li>
</ul>
		<p>&quotThe unexamined life is not worth living&quot</p>

		<h3>Existentialism</h3>
      <img src="Exis.jpeg">
		<p>Life has no fixed meaning; you must create your own.
You&apos;re born, but no manual comes with life. You decide your purpose.
You exist first, then give yourself meaning.</p>
		<p>&quot;Existence precedes essence.&quot;</p>
		<p>&quot;Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.&quot;</p>

		<h3>Nihilism</h3>
      <img src="Nihi.webp">
		<p>Life has no inherent meaning or value at all.
Nothing really matters in the end.
But some use it as freedom: if nothing matters, you&apos;re free from rules and expectations.</p>
		<p>&quotTo live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering&quot</p>
		<p>&quotBut in the end one needs more courage to live than to kill himself&quot</p>

		<h3>Stoicism</h3>
      <img src="Stoic.jpeg">
		<p>You cannot control what happens, only how you react.
Example: If it rains, you can&apos;t stop it. But you can decide not to be upset.</p>
		<p>&quotWe suffer more often in imagination than in reality.&quot</p>
		
		<p>&quotThe more we value things outside our control, the less control we have.&quot</p>
		</section>
		<h3>Why I chose Spiritual/Philosophy</h3>
		<p>For a long time I only kept going through the flow of life; school, hang-out with friends, play, repeat. Until a few years I started losing interest in those, combined with the pandemic, I had a lot of time to think. I asked &quot;what is our purpose?; why were we born? why go through so much just to die?&quot;. That is when I started learning about philosophy, it turns out theres a vast amount of people who&apos;ve had these thoughts before, even centuries ago.</p>
		<p>I like philosophy because unlike religion, it has logical explanations and more practical lessons in life. I would say I&apos;m an existentialist/stoic, I recognize that life has no meaning, but you can give it meaning, whether through your career, family, goals, or other things. I also do not want to focus on things I can&apos;t control. <br>For me at this period of my life, the meaning I give is, &quot;Keep moving forward&quot;. You may face challenges, lose hope, fail, at the end of the day, time passes and everyone moves on. You might as well keep moving forward, no point in looking back at the past.</p>
		<p>You need to keep riding the wave of life, not watching it from the shore.</p>
		<h3>Lastly, let me share my favorite painting and its value to me.</h3>

		<h3>The Wanderer above the Sea of Fog</h3>
		<p>When I watched a video essay about it, the youtuber emphasized the importance of the man's back being turned, for paintings of the time always had front-facing characters. The author intentionally did this to represent moving forward. As a viewer we are unsure if the man just finished his journey or about to embark on one, the artist shows that that is irrelevant but what matters is the man is looking forward.</p>
